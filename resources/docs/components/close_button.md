## Example
Provide an option to dismiss or close a component with .btn-close. Default styling is limited, but highly customizable. Modify the Sass variables to replace the default background-image. Be sure to include text for screen readers, as we’ve done with aria-label.

## Disabled state
Disabled close buttons change their opacity. We’ve also applied pointer-events: none and user-select: none to preventing hover and active states from triggering.

## White variant
Change the default .btn-close to be white with the .btn-close-white class. This class uses the filter property to invert the background-image.
