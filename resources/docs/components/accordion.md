## How it works
The accordion uses collapse internally to make it collapsible. To render an accordion thatâ€™s expanded, add the .open class on the .accordion.

> The animation effect of this component is dependent on the prefers-reduced-motion media query. See the reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation.

## Example
Click the accordions below to expand/collapse the accordion content.

## Flush
Add .accordion-flush to remove the default background-color, some borders, and some rounded corners to render accordions edge-to-edge with their parent container.

## Always open
Omit the data-bs-parent attribute on each .accordion-collapse to make accordion items stay open when another item is opened.

## Accessibility
Please read the collapse accessibility section for more information.
