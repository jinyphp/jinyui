## Colors
Convey meaning through color with a handful of color utility classes. Includes support for styling links with hover states, too.

## Colors
Colorize text with color utilities. If you want to colorize links, you can use the .link-* helper classes which have :hover and :focus states.

> Deprecation: With the addition of .text-opacity-* utilities and CSS variables for text utilities, .text-black-50 and .text-white-50 are deprecated as of v5.1.0. They’ll be removed in v6.0.0.

> Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies – such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the .visually-hidden class.

## Opacity

As of v5.1.0, text color utilities are generated with Sass using CSS variables. This allows for real-time color changes without compilation and dynamic alpha transparency changes.
